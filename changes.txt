CoCo2_20240701 - 008
1:	Prelim recursion testing spreadsheet completed.
2:	Updated MiSTer template
3:	Added Daily Build Number.  Note sys/build_num.tcl changed to add this functionality.
	Updating the template in the future will need to restore this version to prevent
	the loss of this functtion.
4:  Change back to Cycle accurate 09
5:  Fixed Timer [The FDC cartridge does not generate a FIRQ when asserted.  This was fixed..]
6:  Preliminary double speed poke in the SAM via SAM registers coded.  WIP
7:  FDC changed to use system clk and divide to 8 Mhz changed to /6.  FIRQ generation
    for Dragon, qualified enabled only in Dragon configurations.

Issues:
1:  Highspeed pokes may be backwards.  Full 1.78Mhz seems to have a video issue.


To Do...
2:    Add Cassette Save
4:    Get FDC working for dragon (edited)
